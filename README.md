### Latent Diffusion Render Engine
Abstract: *A **Latent Diffusion Engine (LDE)** is a machine learning model that generates images by gradually refining random noise into a coherent output. It operates in a latent space, where it reverses a diffusion process (turning noise back into data) to create high-quality results.*
